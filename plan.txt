project outline / ideas

basically how it will work is:

I first will get all of the data from the api regarding
which objects to put in my smooth and responsive ui data.
	-research their api via their github
        -use fetch
	-research displaying responsive data in react

I will also create a little drag and drop box that -on drop-
adds the piece of data to the local storage
	-push it in and act like the object is an array?
	-perhaps use the name as the key and other data as value?

Then as that changes the app will 'react' and fill the gearbag with
the new items.

for the layout, on desktop or tablet the bag will be off to the side
and for the mobile it will be at the bottom. Either way it will hover
in place as the items are scrolled.

react classes i will need

Grid Element { apiData}
Grid {array of gridElements - informed by api req}
Bag {array of gridElements - informed by localStorage}
